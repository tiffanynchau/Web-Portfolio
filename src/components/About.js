            <p>
              Hi there! My name is Tiffany Chau, and I am a software engineer
              based in Austin, Texas. I am passionate about building web
              applications that not only look great but also perform
              exceptionally well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects, ranging
              from social media platforms to job application management tools. I
              take pride in writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code, and
              I am constantly seeking ways to improve my skills and stay
              up-to-date with the latest technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
              <ul>
                <Row>
                  <Col>
                    <li> JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
                    <li> TypeScript</li>
                    <li> React</li>
                    <li> Node.js</li>
                  </Col>
                  <Col>
                    <li> Express</li>
                    <li> HTML5/CSS3</li>
                    <li> SQL / NoSQL</li>
                  </Col>
                </Row>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </Col>
          <Col xs={12} md={6} xl={5}>
            <img className="headshot" src={selfphoto} />
          </Col>
        </Row>
      </Container>
    </section>
  );
};
